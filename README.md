# gmail-mental-arithmetics
Todo chrome extension for mental arithmetic exercise in Gmail

## Rough idea

1. User clicks on send
2. User is prompted a random exercise that can be + - / * . Example: 4 + 9 = ?
3. If responded correctly, email is sent.
4. If wrong, user can retry 2 more times.
5. After 3 tries in total, email is sent. 

## Reasons/Objectives

1. Engage the user's brain right - a simple mental refresh (a small and relatively easy -- can get rpgressively tougher based on building accurate responses -- math operation to refresh the mind
2. A simple praise for a right answer or an encouragement for a wrong answer
3. How do we get users to install the extension, once it's published in the Chrome Web Store - do we market it? How do we make the general public aware of this extension ?
